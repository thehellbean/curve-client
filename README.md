# Curve Client

Curve is a multiplayer game where you control a dot which leaves a trail behind it. If you crash into a trail, your own or another players', you lose. The goal of the game is to be the last one standing. It's heavily inspired by games like Achtung die Kurve and Netacka.

This repo is a web client which works with [this server](https://github.com/thehellbean/curve-server)

The frontend uses a basic React/Redux-app and the canvas-API to handle UI and gameplay.
